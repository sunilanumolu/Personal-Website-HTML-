    <article> I was very fascinated in dance from My childhood but I never gone to any coaching.
              I used to in my bedroom before the mirror and while bathing. I like the swag type
              of Dance and also that with lot of feel and expressions.My interset in dance has 
              increased alot after started watching Dance +3.It increased alot after started 
              watching Dance Champions which is the INDIA's best dance competition.My favorite
              dancers are RAGHAV JUYAL and SUSHANT KHATRI.Above is my Favourite dance video.
