             I had started taking Photos very recently after joining in IIIT HYDERABAD.
             I got interest in photography slowly.Now I am loving taking photos.I like
             the things to be arranged in a order which brings me interst in photography.
             The interesting and exciting part in photography comes with handling the
             DSLR camera as it will have a large variations of features.For better images
             we have to do photoshaping and lightroom operations.I am now so fascinated
             in Photography and using adobe Lightroom.
